## Security Considerations

ComicPacker processes comic files and archives. While we strive to ensure the safety of the application, users should:

1. Only process files from trusted sources
2. Keep their system and dependencies up to date
3. Regularly review the code if using in a sensitive environment

The application does not intentionally collect or transmit any user data or personal information.
